Index: IN python -1 represents the last
Formatted strings can be used without having to break the sentence quotes to fill in variables. 
Msg = f'{first_name} [{last_name}] is a coder'
	This will print Aditya [Tummala] is a coder
In the above example, use f to begin and put variables under {}

First_name.upper()
This is a function specific to the strings. Such functions are called as Methods. When a function belongs to something else or specific object, then it is called method
Len(first_name) or print(first_name) are functions as they are general purpose

First_name.find('P') will find the first occurrence of capital P and returns the index. You can also pass sequence of characters 'Python'. Similarly replace method

Find gives the index and in operator gives boolean value
Print('Python' in course) returns true if the value is present in course

Module in python is a separate file that contains reusable functions
Import <module name>
Eg: import math
And then I can use all math functions like math.ceil(), math.floor()

List.append(value)
List.insert(index, value)
List.remove(value)
List.clear()
List.pop() - last item in the list is removed
List.index(value) - gives index of the first occurrence of the value
Print(value in list) - prints the boolean value
List.count(value) - gives the occurences of the value
List.sort()
List.reverse() - first sort and then reverse it to get the values in descending order
List.copy() - copy the list into another list

Coordinates = [1, 2, 3]
X, y, z = coordinates - if we do this then list values are assigned to those variables, This is called unpacking

Tuples is when you use () instead of []

Customer["name"] if this gives an error as the key "name" doesn’t exist in the dictionary, use get method as follows
Customer.get("name", default value)
If name doesn’t exist, then get will display the default value

When a user enters the input, it can be split into multiple values in a list
Eg: message = input(">"
	Words = message.split(' ')      here space is the separater to create the list
	Print(words)       wll print output as ['Good', 'Morning', 'Sunshine']
	
Use key word arguments to improve readability of the code
Use key word arguments always after positional arguments 

Try:
	Age = int(input(">"))
	Income = 20000
	Some_value = income/age
Except ZeroDivisionError:
	Print("Age cannot be zero")

Classes can be used to define new types. Always start with a capital and do not use underscore
 Objects are instances of classes

Constructors - initiate self through __init__(self, x, y) where x and y are variables and whose value can be passed through the object, while creating the object

Inheritance 
Class Dog(Mammal):
In the above example, all methods under Mammal are inherited into Dog class

Modules are files containing python code. If I have a file called converters.py that contains 2 functions - convert kgs to lbs and vice versa. Now in my new file, I just have to type at the beginning
	Ø Import converters
Now converters is an object and I can access its methods by just typing converters.<method name>

If we want to import just one function, then 
	Ø From converters import kg_to_lbs
Now the new function can be accessed by just giving kg_to_lbs(10)
